Introduction and Abstract:
Hypothesis testing is crucial for assessing credit risk and calibrating rating systems. Two-sided tests can detect both over- and underestimation of credit risk. Regulators and risk-averse investors primarily care about underestimating risk, requiring one-sided tests. Established one-sided tests individually evaluate rating classes and aggregate the results. Individual rating class tests may overlook the underperformance of the entire rating system. Joint tests that assess all rating classes simultaneously improve detection capability. Joint tests use Sterne’s method (1954), ranking outcomes by probability for multiple classes.

Fundamental Concepts of Hypothesis Testing:
Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (H0). Power = 1 – Probability of failing to reject H0 when the alternative hypothesis (H1) is true. Increasing statistical power means reducing Type II errors (false negatives).

Normal Distribution & Probability:
Under the normal distribution curve, approximately 68.2% of values lie within ±1 standard deviation (SD). Around 95.2% of values fall within ±2 SD. Approximately 99.6% of data lies within ±3 SD from the mean.

Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis:
Univariate analysis involves testing hypotheses with a single variable. Bivariate analysis examines relationships between exactly two variables. Multivariate analysis tests hypotheses involving three or more variables or variable sets.

Multiple Comparisons and Error Rates:
Using a p-value of 0.05 means accepting a 5% risk of false positives (Type I error). Conducting multiple comparisons (e.g., 18 subgroups) significantly increases false positive likelihood. Independent tests multiply the probability of Type I errors across comparisons.

Factors Affecting Power:
The power of a statistical test increases with the size of the effect. Reduced standard deviation of the data characteristic also increases power. Larger sample sizes improve test power significantly. Choosing a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10 instead of 0.05) can increase power but also increases risk of Type I error.

Practical Examples on Power Calculation:
Study 1: 50 cases and 50 controls resulted in power near 100%, providing strong test reliability.
Study 2: 18 treated vs. 72 controls with STD DEV=2 and a clinically relevant difference of 4 points had around 50% power.
Study design significantly influences power, demonstrating importance of careful planning.

Bayesian Hypothesis Testing Fundamentals:
Bayesian methods offer alternatives to classical hypothesis testing, accounting for prior knowledge. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) integrates multiple models, weighting them according to their posterior probabilities.

Model Selection Techniques for Bayesian Analysis:
Marginal likelihood can be estimated by Grid Approximation method. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a common frequentist approach adapted in Bayesian contexts. Simulation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are extensively used for complex Bayesian models.

Application of Bayesian Model Averaging in Financial Stress Testing:
Handpicked models, while economically sound, may underestimate credit risk and default flows. Underestimating credit risk can lead to overoptimistic capital absorption estimates. Bayesian model averaging reduces biases introduced by selecting overly optimistic models. The proposed Bayesian averaging approach provides conservatism and comparability across banks.

Practical Scenario of Bayesian Models in Financial Institutions:
The presented stress test models targeted 18 European Union countries. These models were applied to 108 Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) banks for rigorous evaluation. Comparing handpicked equations to Bayesian averaging illustrated the former's optimistic bias.

Conclusion and Implications:
Joint tests based on Sterne’s ranking approach significantly enhance credit risk model back-testing. Implementing Bayesian model averaging can strengthen regulatory compliance and improve risk estimation precision in financial institutions.
